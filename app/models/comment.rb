  # `post_id`. This has the benefit of Rails checking whether the post *actually* exists,

  # Comments belong to posts. This means there is one and only one post associated with a
  # comment (this could be nil, so we also added a validator). In order for this to work,
  # a column named `post_id` needs to exist on the `comments` table.
